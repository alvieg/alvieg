# 🦈/🤕🔨 HammerHead

I'm a developer interested in web apps and game websites using APIs and backend servers.

---

## 🧠 Languages I Know

- Python
- HTML
- Svelte
- Markdown
- JavaScript
- CSS
- ~C++

  ("~" Means I'm still working on it)

---

## 💎 Favorite Language  

[**SvelteKit**](https://svelte.dev) — The JS framework that allows for dynamic pages and routing. It allows for easier coding with components that can be reused and layouts that define how a page should look. It also has backend servers that can be used for any project.

## 🔧 Currently Building

### [SNKRFinder](https://snkrfinder.net)

A website that I am building with [Developers Fun](https://github.com/developers-fun). It fetches Sneakers from GOAT, FlightClub and StockX and provides an easy access point to find good, cheap sneakers. It uses SvelteKit and the sneaks-api package.
